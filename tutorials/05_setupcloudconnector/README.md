# Configure systems in SAP Cloud Connector 

## Introduction

In this section you are going to configure the SAP Cloud Connector to connect your SAP S/4HANA on-premise system with your SAP Business Technology Platform subaccount. 

> Find more details about the installation of the SAP Cloud Connector on [help.sap.com](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html)

### Configure Systems in SAP Cloud Connector for access with technical user

1. If you don't have an SAP Cloud Connector installed yet (for example, because you have set up the SAP S/4HANA system via the SAP Cloud Appliance library), please go through the installation steps described on [help.sap.com](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html).

2. In a Web browser, enter: `https://<hostname>` : `<port>`.
    - `<hostname>` refers to the machine on which the Cloud Connector is installed. If installed on your machine, you can simply enter localhost.
    - `<port>` is the Cloud Connector port specified during installation (the default port is 8443).

    On the logon screen, enter Administrator / manage (case sensitive) for `User Name` / `Password`.
    
    > Hint: adjust the port if you specified another one during the installation. Potentially you might have to use the external IP of your system. 

2. Choose *Add Subaccount* and enter the following data. The required information can be found in your SAP BTP subaccount overview.
    - Region
    - Subaccount
    - Display Name
    - Subaccount User
    - Password
    ![Select Region from the list with values from subaccount](./images/select_region.png)
    ![Copy Subaccount ID from SAP BTP subaccount overview](./images/select_subaccount.png)
    Continue with *Save*.
    
3. Navigate to **Cloud to On-Premise**. 
4. To add a new system mapping click on the **+** icon on the right site.

    > Provide the actual hostname and port of your S/4HANA on-premise system!
8. Provide a virtual hostname and port that will later on be used in *Destinations* to reach your on S/4HANA on-premise system using the SAP Cloud Connector. Those values don't exist yet - choose a name for the virtual host yourself.

# Configure systems in SAP Cloud Connector 

## Introduction

In this section you are going to configure the SAP Cloud Connector to connect your SAP S/4HANA on-premise system with your SAP Business Technology Platform subaccount. 

> Find more details about the installation of the SAP Cloud Connector on [help.sap.com](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html)

### Configure Systems in SAP Cloud Connector for access with technical user

1. If you don't have an SAP Cloud Connector installed yet (for example, because you have set up the SAP S/4HANA system via the SAP Cloud Appliance library), please go through the installation steps described on [help.sap.com](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html).

2. In a Web browser, enter: `https://<hostname>` : `<port>`.
    - `<hostname>` refers to the machine on which the Cloud Connector is installed. If installed on your machine, you can simply enter localhost.
    - `<port>` is the Cloud Connector port specified during installation (the default port is 8443).

    On the logon screen, enter Administrator / manage (case sensitive) for <User Name> / <Password>.
    
    > Hint: adjust the port if you specified another one during the installation. Potentially you might have to use the external IP of your system.

    - Region
    - Subaccount

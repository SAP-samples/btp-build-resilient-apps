# Deploy SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) Application

## Introduction

Clone an existing CAP application in SAP Business Application Studio and deploy it to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime.

### Clone the existing application in SAP Business Application Studio

1.	Make sure you have opened your *SAP BTP Account* and navigate to your *subaccount*.
   
2.	Go to *Services* and select *Instances and Subscriptions*.
   
3.	Select **SAP Business Application Studio** located in the *Subscriptions* tab and click on the icon to open the application.

4. Create a **Dev Space** once the SAP Business Application Studio home appears.
   ![Create Dev Space](./images/dev-cap-app-3.png)

5.	Enter a **Dev Space name** e.g 'BusinessProcess', select the type *Full Stack Cloud Application*.
   DonÂ´t forget to click on the button *Create Dev Space*
   ![Configure Dev Space](./images/dev-cap-app-4.png)
    
6.	Your Dev Space is now being created. As soon as the Dev Space is running you can click on your Dev Space name to  access it.

7. Go to <https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-build-resilient-apps> and fork the repository. So that you have a dedicated fork on github.com. In one of the subsequent steps you can connect your fork with the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service to run certain pipelines. 
   ![Fork Repo](./images/fork-repo.png)
   > the screenshot was created when the repository was still private. that's why the fork button appears to be disabled. 

8. Choose your user as destination for the fork. 
   ![Choose user for fork](./images/fork-repo-user.png)

   You should now have the following repository: github.com/**YourUser**/btp-build-resilient-apps.git.
   > To Update the dependencies automatically using GitHub Actions [GitHub Actions to Update Dependencies](#gitHub-actions-to-update-dependencies)

9.	Choose *Terminal -> New Terminal* in the menu on the top of your screen.
   ![Open Terminal](./images/dev-cap-app-5.png)

10. In the opened terminal go to projects folder with executing

   ``` 
   cd projects
   ```

11. Clone your forked sample GitHub repository for this mission. 

    ```
    git clone -b extension https://github.com/YourUser/btp-build-resilient-apps
    ```
    
    > **IMPORTANT:** Replace **YourUser** with your actual username. 

12. Click on *File* in the menu on the top and choose *Open Workspace* in the Dropdown menu.
   ![Open Workspace](./images/dev-cap-app-7.png)

13. Open the project by selecting projects -> btp-build-resilient-apps and click on *Open*

14. Run the application locally in your SAP Business Application Studio environment by executing the following command in the root directory of your project in the terminal:

    ```
    cds watch
    ```

    Click on `Expose and Open` in the appearing PopUp. 
   ![Open App](./images/bas-0.png)


14. To logon to the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime follow these steps:

    - Click on **View > Find Command** in the menu on the top.
     ![Find Command](./images/bas-1.png)
     
    - Search for **Login to Cloud Foundry** and press **Enter** to confirm.
      ![Login to Cloud Foundry](./images/bas-2.png)

    - Copy & Paste the API Endpoint of your subaccount from the SAP BTP Cockpit. 
      ![Login to Cloud Foundry](./images/bas-3.png)

    - Follow the process by entering the credentials of your SAP BTP account and by selecting the Cloud Foundry org and space you want to deploy the application to.

> NOTE: to add test cases please check [Test cases for SAP CAP Application](#test-cases-for-sap-cap-application)

15. Build the Multi-Target Application Archive (MTA Archive) by executing the following command in the root directory of your project in the terminal:

    ```
    mbt build -e trial.mtaext --mtar BPVerification.mtar
    ```

> **IMPORTANT:** this will produce a .mtar file in the mta_archives directory. Some of the values for the service instance creation depend on the environment you are deploying to, that's why the *-e* for *extension* is used here. If you are using a production environment, use <code>mbt build -e live.mtaext</code>

16. Deploy the application to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime by executing the following command in the root directory of your project in the terminal:

    ```
    cf deploy mta_archives/BPVerification.mtar
    ```

    This will trigger the deployment to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime including the creation of the necessary service instances and service bindings to the corresponding apps. 
    
    
## Test cases for SAP CAP Application

1. Please find the test cases available in the directory **btp-build-resilient-apps/tests/**.

 ![github actions](./images/test-1.png)

2. The test cases are split up into two seperate files, namely **odata-negative.js** and **odata.js**.

 ![github actions](./images/test-2.png)
 
3. All the test cases are written in [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - (Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node). An example can look as follows:

 ![github actions](./images/test-3.png)
 
4. The "/admin/$metadata" Path (the metadata service document of one of the OData services from the deployed CAP application) is validated against two conditions -  the response code and response header. 

 ![github actions](./images/test-4.png)
 
 The respone code needs to to be **200** and the response header should contain **content-type** to equal **"application/xml"** and **odata-version** to be **4.0**.

5. Adding these scripts to the package.json has already been done.

![github actions](./images/test-5.png)

6. These test cases can now be executed from the terminal using <code>npm run test:odata_negative</code> or <code>npm run test:odata</code> 

![github actions](./images/test-6.png)

>Note: Adding the Test Cases to SAP Continuous Integration & Delivery pipeline will be shown in the [Setup CI/CD Pipeline](../10-SetupCICD/README.md)

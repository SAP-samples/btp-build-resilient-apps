# Approve/Reject a Business Partner using SAP Workflow Management

## Description

In this step, you are going to use SAP Workflow Management to enhance the already existing CAP application. The SAP Fiori Elements UI to the already existing CAP application offers two buttons to block or unblock a Business Partner in the SAP S/4HANA on-premise system. Once these buttons are pressed, a new workflow instance in SAP Workflow Management is triggered and sent to the person in charge for this Business Partner. To find out who is responsible for this business partner, the Business Rules capability of SAP Workflow Management is used. 

## Setup SAP Workflow Management
